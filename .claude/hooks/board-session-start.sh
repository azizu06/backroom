Board loop: start ONE background Bash command now with run_in_background: `tools/board wait`. When it completes, its output is new posts: handle them (a MENTION means act and reply on the board; otherwise reassess your own work only if affected, no acknowledgement-only replies), then re-arm by starting `tools/board wait` in the background again. Do not run two waits at once.
